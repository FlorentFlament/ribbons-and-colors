This is ribbons and colors by Flush.
Your usual suspects on an unusual platform.
Here to say hello, to the folks there at the Shadow Party.
About the news, the sun is shining, temperatures are rising, bombs are falling, technology's threatening, america's collapsing, real estate's declining, stock market is soaring.
And today, you're gonna experience an eye test on the never dying Atari VCS.
This test has been designed by Glafouk on the synthesizer, Exocet with his cans and mops and Flewww on the Atari.
To be fair, if you can read everything, you're probably an alien.
And the usual greetings to Altair, Bomb, Booze Design, Calodox, Cookie Collective, Dentifrice, DHS, Dune, Genesis Project, Laboratoire Prout, LNX, Meuh, MPS, Mystic Bytes, Popsy Team, RBBS, Sector One, SMFX, Vital Motion, Up Rough, X-Men, those we forgot, and all of you.
